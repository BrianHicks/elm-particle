# elm-particle

Simple particle system for web apps.
Designed for visual flourishes like confetti.

```
elm install BrianHicks/elm-particle
```

## Getting Started

The general overview of elm-particle:

1. Create a Random generator for the types of particles you want.
2. Combine those to make effects, like confetti bursting or a stream of water.
3. Give those to a system which manages random seeds and animation frame subscriptions for you!

You can see fully worked examples online:

- ðŸŽ‰ [Confetti](https://brianhicks.github.io/elm-particle/Confetti.html)
- ðŸš° [Water](https://brianhicks.github.io/elm-particle/Water.html)
- ðŸŽ‡ [Fireworks](https://brianhicks.github.io/elm-particle/Firework.html)

The source for these examples all live in the `examples` directory on GitHub.

If you'd like to see how this is done step-by-step, I gave a [20-minute presentation at Olso Elm Day 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goL7LeDHFi4).
There's also [an Elm town episode on the background behind elm-particle](https://elmtown.simplecast.fm/confetti-and-waterfalls).

## Climate Action

I want my open-source activities to support projects addressing the climate crisis (for example, projects in clean energy, public transit, reforestation, or sustainable agriculture.)
If you are working on such a project, and find a bug or missing feature in any of my libraries, **please let me know and I will treat your issue as high priority.**
I'd also be happy to support such projects in other ways.
In particular, I've worked with Elm for a long time and would be happy to advise on your implementation.
