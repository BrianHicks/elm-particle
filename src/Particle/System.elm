{-| Hold and simulate all your particles at once! This is a whole lot easier
than managing all the subscriptions and emitters yourself.
-}
type System a
    = System
        { seed : Random.Seed
        , particles : List (Particle a)
        }


{-| Get a `System` given a seed. So, why do I need that? Well, it's much nicer
to generate random particles if we can do it synchronously, so I keep track of a
seed so we can do everything in one call to your `update`! If you don't really
care about the seed, you can initialize it like this:

    init (Random.initialSeed 0)

If you want one that's actually pseudo-random, get a random seed with the
`Random.independentSeed` generator or pass the current time in when you
initialize your app from JavaScript.

-}
init : Random.Seed -> System a
init seed =
    System
        { seed = seed
        , particles = []
        }


{-| Get me from [`sub`](#sub) and pass me to [`update`](#update)!
-}
type Msg a
    = NewFrame Float (List (Particle a)) Random.Seed


{-| Make a burst of a bunch of particles at once! Use this for things like
confetti or fireworks. We use randomness here because 100 particles all doing
exactly the same thing tends to be uninteresting.

If you haven't used the `Random` library before, check the docs at the top of
`Particle`.

We could make a burst of 50 confetti particles like this:

    burst (Random.list 50 confettiParticles) system

-}
burst : Generator (List (Particle a)) -> System a -> System a
burst generator (System system) =
    let
        ( particles, nextSeed ) =
            Random.step generator system.seed
    in
    System { system | particles = particles ++ system.particles, seed = nextSeed }


{-| Update all the particles by one step. Use it in your `update` function
whenever you get a [`Msg`](#Msg). Probably like this:

    update msg model.system

-}
update : Msg a -> System a -> System a
update (NewFrame delta particles seed) (System system) =
    System
        { particles = List.filterMap (Particle.update delta) (particles ++ system.particles)
        , seed = seed
        }


{-| View all the particles in the system. You'll need to provide a rendering
function for each particle—the same one you'd give to `Particle.view`—as well as
a list of attributes on the SVG element itself.

For example, if you wanted a full-screen particle display, it would look like
this:

    view viewConfetti
        [ Html.Attributes.style "width" "100%"
        , Html.Attributes.style "height" "100vh"
        ]
        system

-}
view : (Particle a -> Svg msg) -> List (Html.Attribute msg) -> System a -> Html msg
view viewParticle attrs (System { particles }) =
    Svg.svg attrs (List.map (Particle.view viewParticle) particles)


{-| Do the same thing as [`view`](#view) but render HTML instead of SVG.
-}
viewHtml : (Particle a -> Html msg) -> List (Html.Attribute msg) -> System a -> Html msg
viewHtml viewParticle attrs (System { particles }) =
    Html.div attrs (List.map (Particle.viewHtml viewParticle) particles)


{-| Subscribe to the right events in the browser. In this case, that's
`requestAnimationFrame` deltas. You don't have to worry about how to hook up the
right functions, just stick this in the subscriptions of your app and call
`update` with the `Msg` you get.

The first parameter here is a list of emitters. These are different than bursts
in that they continuously spout particles. This can create particle effects like
water or fire. They live in the subscription so that we can manage our
subscriptions intelligently. It also means that you don't have to store
generators—which contain functions—in your model. So maybe you want to turn a
stream of water on and off, or control the pressure? That's great! You can store
those parameters in your model, and use them to make your generators.

Each emitter gets the time since the last frame in milliseconds so that it can
calculate how many particles to emit. So, for example, a water emitter that
emitted 60 drops per second may look like this:

    waterEmitter : Float -> Generator (List (Particle Droplet))
    waterEmitter delta =
        Random.list (ceiling (delta * (60 / 1000))) dropletGenerator

Then you'd use this in your subscription like this:

    sub [ waterEmitter ] ParticleMsg model.system

If this doesn't make sense, go read the [`Water.elm`][water] example, which ties
all of this together.
